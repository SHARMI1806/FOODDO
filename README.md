# Overview

Food waste is increasing at an alarming rate and is one of the most common problems that almost every household possesses. The application DoFood aims to provide 
donors and consumers a platform to connect and exchange unwanted/excess food. The idea is that donors post about having excess food resources, thus making it 
available for charities and consumers. They can then easily connect and communicate with each other. People can also enroll as volunteers to help in food exchange 
activities and thus contribute toward betterment of society.

DoFood can make the overall process of food exchange and donation smooth between the donors and charities by involving volunteers as a bridge. 
It aims to strengthen the bond of donations between different charities and donors so that the charities never get short on their foods and the needy ones get 
their required quantities of food whenever required. Moreover, if an individual wants to volunteer for some charity as a civic activity, then DoFood can prove as 
a good platform for searching charities to work with. We believe that this informative application has the power to unite the donors and charities in order to tackle 
the global problem of food deficiency.
