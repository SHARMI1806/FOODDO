# Overview

One of the most prevalent issues that practically every household faces is the worrying rise in food waste. DoFood is an app that connects donors and consumers so they may exchange surplus or unwanted food. Donors are supposed to write about having extra food supplies so that organisations and consumers can use them. Once connected, they may simply speak with one another. Additionally, anyone can sign up as volunteers to assist in food exchange activities and thereby improve society.
By using volunteers as a bridge, DoFood can make the trade and gift of food between donors and organisations seamless.It strives to increase the connection between contributors and charities so that the charities never run out of food and the hungry always receive the necessary amounts of food. DoFood can also prove to be a useful platform for finding charities to work with if someone wants to volunteer for a charity as a civic duty. We think that our application can help organisations and donors work together to address the worldwide issue of food insecurity.
